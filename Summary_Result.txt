So far I have created six models via SVM:

linear SVM: Basic Features, Shearlet Features, Basic Features+Shearlet
nonlin SVM: Basic Features, Shearlet Features, Basic Features+Shearlet

Note: by Basic Features I mean entropy, std, rms, skewness, kurtosis and average

The performance of the six different models can be seen in the corresponding .txt files, called Report_...

The best performance was achieved for the nonlinear SVM trained with the basic Features (accuracy 0.58).

As soon as the wavelet features are extracted I will created 4 more models, namely

linear SVM: wavelet, wavelet+basic
nonlin SVM: wavelet, wavelet+basic
