The best two models I created use both a nonlinear kernel and the robust scaler:
One of the models uses the Basic Features, while the other model uses the optimal combination
of wavelet features. Both models achieve a accurancy of 0.64. Since the Basic Features are easier 
to extract I would recommend to use the Basic_SVM_RobustScaler model.
