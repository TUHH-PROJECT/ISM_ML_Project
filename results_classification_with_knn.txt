test k_neighbourg for 1 < k < 500
for comparison it is evident that a random classifier would have 25% of accuracy, bc we have value for the label

  with gray average only : 49 %  with k = 296 (best)
  with gray entropy only : 51 %  with k = 101 (best)
  with gray rms only : 50 %  with k = 391  (best)
  with gray kurtosis only : 50 %  with k = 206 (best)
  with gray skewness only : 49 %  with k = 311 (best)
  with gray std only : 52 %  with k = 91 (best)

  with entropy and skewness : 53 % with k = 126 (best)
  with entropy skewness std rms : 59 % with k = 26 (best)

  with the 6 features : 62 % with k = 16 (best)
